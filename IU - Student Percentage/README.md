## What That Plugin Do?
Designed for a specific ERP...

How much fee the student has paid in percentage and also tells how much minimum fee is required to sit in Mid-Term Examination

In Indus University student has to pay minimum amount to sit in examination. That calculation contains Current Semester Tuition Fee 50% and rest of all the dues like Library Fee, Examination Fee, and Fines etc or any previous Balance to be paid 100% and there are also many other things for example Subtracting Scholorships or any advance fee paid accordingly (like settling advance fee paid with other fee besides tuition fee then add remaining to tuition fee and check that either 50% tuition fee is paid or not).

So as you can see it requires alot of calculations so that we get the right amount and then generate voucher, With this plugin It will replace Old "Pending Balance Detail" with the percentage of fee paid and required amount to be paid to be eligible for examination
